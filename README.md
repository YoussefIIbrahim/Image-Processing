# Image-Processing
This is a project for Analysis and Processing of Biometric Images course.
Analyzing images and applying some simple algorithms ordered as follows:
1. Conversion to grayscale
2. Color inversion
3. Brightness adjustment
4. Contrast adjustment
5. Global thresholding
6. Half thresholding
7. Local thresholding (Bernsen algorithm)
8. Horizontal/Vertical projection
9. Histogram normalization
10. Gaussian filter
11. Sharpening filter (Laplacian)
12. Sobel filter
13. Roberts cross
